# Project-3

#Proposal

The field we are interested in working with Covid Vaccines in US states. Covid has effected everyone's lives and it would be impactful to find about its vaccines distribution. The data we would be working with is a data collected for US states Covid vaccine provided by Kaggle.com. The dataset contains more than 100 unique records.

We will scrape the dataset and will perform all the analysis including data visualizations for data sets. [data_cleaning.ipynb]

Data Source: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/usa-covid19-vaccinations)

Analysis

While this subject could be studied indefinitely, we decided the following questions to be the best topics for the project:

1.  State with highest vaccinations.

2. Total Vaccinations for different State.

3. Total number of people fully vaccinated(including percentage).

4. Daily doses of vaccines provided.

These are the main takeways we found based on the dataset, each file will go into further detail in their respective markdown tabs.
